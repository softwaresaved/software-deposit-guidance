title: "Software Deposit Guidance for Researchers"

# Introduction

Research software is an integral part of the modern research ecosystem. Taken together, research software, alongside data, facilities, equipment and an overarching research question can be viewed as a research activity or experiment, worthy to be published. Conversely, a publication can be considered as a narrative that describes how the research objects are used together to reply to the research question.

Depositing research software into a digital repository can offer significant benefits. By depositing not just papers, but software, and data sets, as well, researchers can store a more complete record of this ecosystem for future use to both the researchers who undertook the research and also the wider research community. Making research software available allows other researchers to inspect, replicate, reproduce and reuse the research, as manifested in the software, in the short term and to inspect, for the historical record, in the long term. It allows research software to remain available beyond the lifetime of any current project, or a researcher's current employment at a specific institution. Digital repositories can also provide unique persistent digital identifiers for software which can be cited and help researchers to get attribution and credit for their research software when it is used by others.

The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk), funded by [Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk), developed a set of complementary guides covering the main aspects of depositing software into digital repositories. These guides are intended for researchers, principal investigators and research leaders and research data and digital repository managers.

## Version 1.0

[Software Deposit: Guidance for Researchers](./SoftwareDepositGuidance.html). This overarching guide provides links to both online versions and PDFs deposited in Zenodo for all the guides in the series.

1. Check that an existing [issue](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-deposit-guidance/issues) has not already been created that may cover the scope of your suggestion or comment. 
2. If an existing issue already covers the scope of your suggestion or comment, then please add your own to the issue.
3. If there isn't an applicable issue then please [create a new issue](https://github.com/softwaresaved/software-deposit-guidance/issues/new).

For minor rewordings or rephrasings:

* Either raise an issue, as above.
* Or create a pull request with the suggested changes:
    - Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.
    - Check out the `master` branch.
    - Read README.md in the `master` branch on how to build the guidance locally.
    - Make your changes to your local fork.
    - Regenerate the HTML and, optionally, PDFs, to ensure your changes look OK.
    - When you are ready to contribute your changes, submit a pull request.
    - Note that changes to diagrams will require editing the diagrams in `images-src/Workflows.pptx` then exporting these as PNG files and saving them in `images/`.
